# Nodes

[[Godot]] is a game engine where everything is a node. To create a player for example, we put together a bunch of nodes.

# Scenes

We can bundle together nodes into reusable packages names scenes.

Scenes are also nestable, wich means that we can create a scene and reuse it as many times as we want in other scenes. For example, we can use the player scene in all of our level scenes.
