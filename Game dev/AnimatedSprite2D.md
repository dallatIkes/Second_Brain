[Official documentation](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_animatedsprite2d.html)

AnimatedSprite2D is similar to the Sprite2D node, except it carries multiple textures as animation frames. Animations are created using a SpriteFrames resource, which allows you to import image files (or a folder containing said files) to provide the animation frames for the sprite. The SpriteFrames resource can be configured in the editor via the SpriteFrames bottom panel.
