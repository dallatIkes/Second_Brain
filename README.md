# 🧠 Second_Brain — Computer Science Notes & Concepts

This repository contains an [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) vault that gathers computer science notes: courses, theoretical notions, concepts discovered through projects, and reworded explanations to make them easier to understand. The goal is to centralize knowledge, create links between ideas, and maintain an evolving learning space.

## 🗂️ Using it with Obsidian

The files can be read directly on GitHub, but the vault is designed to be used with Obsidian in order to take advantage of the backlink system and the graph view, which are especially useful for visualizing relationships between concepts.

## 📚 Content

- Summaries and course sheets  
- Personal notes and simplified explanations of technical concepts  
- Diagrams and links between different topics  
- Organization based on interconnected Markdown files  

## 🔄 Structure

Each note is a Markdown file linked to others through internal links, forming a coherent system that works like a digital “second brain.”
