# Basics

Regression is a bit different form [[Classification|classification]] because it doesn't produce a whole number. It is best suited to predict prices, distances and so on.

The basic idea in linear regression is to add up the feature variables to produce the predicted value. The technical term for adding up process is linear combination. 

**Intercept :** technical term for the starting point before any input (ex: women that don't smoke nor eat vegetables, number of lines of code written without drinking any coffee). ^372119

**Ex:** Suppose that we're given the gender, the amounts of cigarettes smoked and vegetables handfuls eaten and the life expectancy of many people. With linear regression it is possible to find the weight of every input.
**Ex:** find the price of each item given the bill with the total and the amount of products bought.

**Logistic regression** is used to find the label of a test data with regression
